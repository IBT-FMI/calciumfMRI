# calciumfMRI
Collection of LabView, Matlab & AFNI tools for simultaneous calcium &amp; fMRI measurements

Update 2018: The Matlab scripts here are now obsolete and have been replaced by a python-based analysis pipeline. The original files will remain in this repository for readers of the Nature Protocols article. The new files can be found under https://github.com/felixsc1/fiberphotometry (unfortunately without comprehensive documentation yet, but the jupyter-notebooks contain explanations about every step).
